  abstract  = {Thyroid cancer represents the most common endocrine malignancy and its incidence is increasing. The majority of thyroid tumours (90-95%) originate from the follicular epithelial cells; it includes several histotypes and related variants characterized by different biological and clinical behavior, such as differentiated papillary and follicular carcinoma (PTC and FTC), and poorly differentiated and anaplastic carcinoma (PDTC and ATC). Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) represents a small fraction of thyroid tumors and originates from the parafollicular C cells. PTCs feature a frequent deregulation of the MAPK pathway, as RET/PTC, TRK, RAS or BRAF oncogenes have been found in about 70% of cases. FTCs are associated with RAS mutations and PAX8/PPARγ oncogenic chromosome rearrangements. PDTCs and ATCs display some alterations occurring in differentiated tumors, as well as other alterations specific of late tumor stages. MTC carry RET or RAS mutations. Here we summarize the molecular alterations detected in each thyroid tumor type, their role in the process of thyroid carcinogenesis, as well as how high-throughput gene expression analyses have contributed to the study of this malignancy.}

In this review, we discuss the application of AI solutions to an equally ubiquitous problem in cytopathology – thyroid fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). Thyroid nodules are common in the general population, and FNAB is the sampling modality of choice. The resulting prevalence in the practicing pathologist’s daily workload makes thyroid FNAB an appealing target for the application of AI solutions. Summary: This review summarizes all available literature on the application of AI to thyroid cytopathology. We follow the evolution from morphometric analysis to convolutional neural networks. We explore the application of AI technology to different questions in thyroid cytopathology, including distinguishing papillary carcinoma from benign, distinguishing follicular adenoma from carcinoma and identifying non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features by key words and phrases. Key Messages: The current literature shows promise towards the application of AI technology to thyroid fine needle aspiration biopsy. Much work is needed to define how this powerful technology will be of best use to the future of cytopathology practice. }},

  abstract = {Accurately cytopathological diagnosis of Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma (PTC) is of importance for reducing costs and increasing efficiency of treatments. In this paper, we pursue that goal by introducing artificial intelligence (AI) for automatic classification of malignant PTC cell clusters from Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) processed by ThinPrep. High-resolution cytological images obtained with a 40 × objective lens digital camera attached to an Olympus microscope were segmented into fragments and then divided into training, validation, and testing subsets. Fragments are non-overlapped patches containing only regions-of-interest that cover informative tissue structures for making proper diagnoses. Deep learning CNN models were pre-trained and fine-tuned on large-scale ImageNet domain before they were re-trained on cytology fragments. Moreover, we proposed a method to compute certainty of the patient-level prediction that undoubtedly provides additional evidence for reliability and confidence of the prediction. Results showed that the best classification performance on digital FNAC images achieved using DenseNet161, obtaining a mean accuracy of 0.9556 (p < 0.01), a mean sensitivity of 0.9734, and a mean specificity of 0.9405 on yet-to-be-seen test-set. Ensemble learning findings suggested combinations of AdaBoost classifier with multiple CNN models boosted predictive performances, up to 0.9971 accuracy. Moreover, stain normalization introduced by Reinhard increased the predictive ability, outperforming histogram specification, and Macenko methods. Presented findings demonstrate deep learning can integrate into computer-aided diagnosis systems to support cytopathologists in accurate diagnosis of PTC.}

  abstract = {Introduction: Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) for identification of papillary carcinoma thyroid is a moderately sensitive and specific modality. The present machine learning tools can correctly classify images into broad categories. Training software for recognition of papillary thyroid carcinoma on FNAC smears will be a decisive step toward automation of cytopathology. Aim: The aim of this study is to develop an artificial neural network (ANN) for the purpose of distinguishing papillary carcinoma thyroid and nonpapillary carcinoma thyroid on microphotographs from thyroid FNAC smears. Subjects and Methods: An ANN was developed in the Python programming language. In the training phase, 186 microphotographs from Romanowsky/Pap-stained smears of papillary carcinoma and 184 microphotographs from smears of other thyroid lesions (at ×10 and ×40 magnification) were used for training the ANN. After completion of training, performance was evaluated with a set of 174 microphotographs (66 – nonpapillary carcinoma and 21 – papillary carcinoma, each photographed at two magnifications ×10 and ×40). Results: The performance characteristics and limitations of the neural network were assessed, assuming FNAC diagnosis as gold standard. Combined results from two magnifications showed good sensitivity (90.48%), moderate specificity (83.33%), and a very high negative predictive value (96.49%) and 85.06% diagnostic accuracy. However, vague papillary formations by benign follicular cells identified wrongly as papillary carcinoma remain a drawback. Conclusion: With further training with a diverse dataset and in conjunction with automated microscopy, the ANN has the potential to develop into an accurate image classifier for thyroid FNACs.}

However, the traditional diagnostic process of FNAC is time-consuming, and its accuracy is highly related to the experience of the cytopathologist. Computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems are rapidly evolving to provide objective diagnostic recommendations. So far, most studies have used fixed-size patches and usually hand-select patches for model training. In this study, we develop a CAD system to address these challenges. In order to be consistent with the diagnostic working mode of cytopathologists, the system is mainly composed of two task modules: the detecting module that is responsible for detecting the regions of interest (ROIs) from the whole slide image of the FNAC, and the classification module that identifies ROIs having positive lesions. The system can then output the top-k ROIs with the highest positive probabilities for the cytopathologists to review. In order to obtain the overall good performance of the system, we compared different object detection and classification models, and used a combination of the YOLOV4 and EfficientNet networks in our system.},

Thus, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the convolutional neural network compared with the American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer using ultrasound images.MATERIALS AND METHODS: From March 2019 to September 2019, seven hundred sixty thyroid nodules (>=10 mm) in 757 patients were diagnosed as benign or malignant through fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or an operation. Experienced radiologists assessed the sonographic descriptors of the nodules, and 1 of 5 American College of Radiology TI-RADS categories was assigned. The convolutional neural network provided malignancy risk percentages for nodules based on sonographic images. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated with cutoff values using the Youden index and compared between the convolutional neural network and the American College of Radiology TI-RADS. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were also compared.RESULTS: Of 760 nodules, 176 (23.2\%) were malignant. At an optimal threshold derived from the Youden index, sensitivity and negative predictive values were higher with the convolutional neural network than with the American College of Radiology TI-RADS (81.8\% versus 73.9\%, P = .009; 94.0\% versus 92.2\%, P = .046).

The development of Artificial Intelligence-assisted algorithms using Cytology digital images has been much more limited due to technical challenges and a lack of optimized scanners for Cytology specimens. Despite the challenges in scanning whole slide images of cytology specimens, there have been many studies evaluating CP to create decision-support tools in Cytopathology. Among different Cytology specimens, thyroid fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) specimens have one of the greatest potentials to benefit from machine learning algorithms (MLA) derived from digital images. Several authors have evaluated different machine learning algorithms focused on thyroid cytology in the past few years. The results are promising. The algorithms have mostly shown increased accuracy in the diagnosis and classification of thyroid cytology specimens. They have brought new insights and demonstrated the potential for improving future cytopathology workflow efficiency and accuracy. However, many issues still need to be addressed to further build on and improve current MLA models and their applications. To optimally train and validate MLA for thyroid cytology specimens, larger datasets obtained from multiple institutions are needed. MLAs hold great potential in improving thyroid cancer diagnostic speed and accuracy that will lead to improvements in patient management.}

Applying a baseline machine learning algorithm trained on scanner ROIs resulted in performance deterioration when applied to the smartphone ROIs (97.8% area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], CI = [95.4%, 100.0%] for scanner images vs 89.5% AUC, CI = [82.3%, 96.6%] for mobile images, P = .019). Preliminary analysis via histogram matching showed that the baseline model was overly sensitive to slight color variations in the images (specifically, to color differences between mobile and scanner images). Adding color augmentation during training reduces this sensitivity and narrows the performance gap between mobile and scanner images (97.6% AUC, CI = [95.0%, 100.0%] for scanner images vs 96.0% AUC, CI = [91.8%, 100.0%] for mobile images, P = .309), with both modalities on par with human pathologist performance (95.6% AUC, CI = [91.6%, 99.5%]) for malignancy prediction (P = .398 for pathologist vs scanner and P = .875 for pathologist vs mobile). For indeterminate cases (pathologist-assigned Bethesda category of 3, 4, or 5), color augmentations confer some improvement (88.3% AUC, CI = [73.7%, 100.0%] for the baseline model vs 96.2% AUC, CI = [90.9%, 100.0%] with color augmentations, P = .158). In addition, we found that our model’s performance levels off after 15 ROIs, a promising indication that ROI data collection would not be time-consuming for our diagnostic system. Finally, we showed that the model has sensible Bethesda category (TBS) predictions (increasing risk malignancy rate with predicted TBS category, with 0% malignancy for predicted TBS 2 and 100% malignancy for TBS 6).}

  abstract = {This review synthesises past research into how machine and deep learning can improve the cyto- and histopathology processing pipelines for thyroid cancer diagnosis. The current gold-standard preoperative technique of fine-needle aspiration cytology has high interobserver variability, often returns indeterminate samples and cannot reliably identify some pathologies; histopathology analysis addresses these issues to an extent, but it requires surgical resection of the suspicious lesions so cannot influence preoperative decisions. Motivated by these issues, as well as by the chronic shortage of trained pathologists, much research has been conducted into how artificial intelligence could improve current pipelines and reduce the pressure on clinicians. Many past studies have indicated the significant potential of automated image analysis in classifying thyroid lesions, particularly for those of papillary thyroid carcinoma, but these have generally been retrospective, so questions remain about both the practical efficacy of these automated tools and the realities of integrating them into clinical workflows. Furthermore, the nature of thyroid lesion classification is significantly more nuanced in practice than many current studies have addressed, and this, along with the heterogeneous nature of processing pipelines in different laboratories, means that no solution has proven itself robust enough for clinical adoption. There are, therefore, multiple avenues for future research: examine the practical implementation of these algorithms as pathologist decision-support systems; improve interpretability, which is necessary for developing trust with clinicians and regulators; and investigate multiclassification on diverse multicentre datasets, aiming for methods that demonstrate high performance in a process- and equipment-agnostic manner.}

  abstract = {Thyroid cancer is the most common malignant endocrine tumor. The key test to assess preoperative risk of malignancy is cytologic evaluation of fine-needle aspiration biopsies (FNABs). The evaluation findings can often be indeterminate, leading to unnecessary surgery for benign post-surgical diagnoses. We have developed a deep-learning algorithm to analyze thyroid FNAB whole-slide images (WSIs). We show, on the largest reported data set of thyroid FNAB WSIs, clinical-grade performance in the screening of determinate cases and indications for its use as an ancillary test to disambiguate indeterminate cases. The algorithm screened and definitively classified 45.1% (130/288) of the WSIs as either benign or malignant with risk of malignancy rates of 2.7% and 94.7%, respectively. It reduced the number of indeterminate cases (N = 108) by reclassifying 21.3% (N = 23) as benign with a resultant risk of malignancy rate of 1.8%. Similar results were reproduced using a data set of consecutive FNABs collected during an entire calendar year, achieving clinically acceptable margins of error for thyroid FNAB classification.}

  abstract = {Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of thyroid nodules is minimally invasive and safe and is usually performed on an outpatient basis. However, the optimal application of FNA requires not only technical skill but also an awareness of the limitations of the procedure, the indications for its use, the factors that affect the adequacy of the biopsy specimen, and the postprocedural management strategy. Ultrasonographic (US) features that are considered indications for FNA include single and multiple thyroid nodules. The results of FNA biopsy are operator dependent. In addition, the results may be affected by the lesion characteristics, the accuracy of lesion and needle localization, the method of guidance, the number of aspirated samples, the needle gauge, the aspiration technique, and the presence or absence of on-site facilities for immediate cytologic examination. With regard to postprocedural management, nodules that are diagnosed as benign on the basis of an adequate FNA specimen should be monitored with follow-up US. Circumstances that necessitate repeat FNA include sample inadequacy, nodule enlargement, cyst recurrence, or clinical or imaging findings that arouse suspicion about the presence of a malignancy even when cytologic findings in the biopsy specimen indicate benignity.

  abstract = {Background The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (TBSRTC) comprises 6 categories used for the diagnosis of thyroid fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). Each category has an associated risk of malignancy, which is important in the management of a thyroid nodule. More accurate predictions of malignancy may help to reduce unnecessary surgery. A machine learning algorithm (MLA) was developed to evaluate thyroid FNAB via whole slide images (WSIs) to predict malignancy. Methods Files were searched for all thyroidectomy specimens with preceding FNAB over 8 years. All cytologic and surgical pathology diagnoses were recorded and correlated for each nodule. One representative slide from each case was scanned to create a WSI. An MLA was designed to identify follicular cells and predict the malignancy of the final pathology. The test set comprised cases blindly reviewed by a cytopathologist who assigned a TBSRTC category. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to assess the MLA performance. Results Nine hundred eight FNABs met the criteria. The MLA predicted malignancy with a sensitivity and specificity of 92.0\% and 90.5\%, respectively. The areas under the curve for the prediction of malignancy by the cytopathologist and the MLA were 0.931 and 0.932, respectively. Conclusions The performance of the MLA in predicting thyroid malignancy from FNAB WSIs is comparable to the performance of an expert cytopathologist. When the MLA and electronic medical record diagnoses are combined, the performance is superior to the performance of either alone. An MLA may be used as an adjunct to FNAB to assist in refining the indeterminate categories.},

Informative areas on a direct smear from a thyroid fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) smear may be spread across a large area comprising blood and dead space. Manually navigating through these areas makes screening and evaluation of FNA smears on a digital platform time-consuming and laborious. We designed a machine learning algorithm that can identify regions of interest (ROIs) on thyroid fine-needle aspiration biopsy WSIs.To evaluate the ability of the machine learning algorithm and screening software to identify and screen for a subset of informative ROIs on a thyroid FNA WSI that can be used for final diagnosis.A representative slide from each of 109 consecutive thyroid fine-needle aspiration biopsies was scanned. A cytopathologist reviewed each WSI and recorded a diagnosis. The machine learning algorithm screened and selected a subset of 100 ROIs from each WSI to present as an image gallery to the same cytopathologist after a washout period of 117 days.Concordance between the diagnoses using WSIs and those using the machine learning algorithm–generated ROI image gallery was evaluated using pairwise weighted κ statistics. Almost perfect concordance was seen between the 2 methods with a κ score of 0.924.Our results show the potential of the screening software as an effective screening tool with the potential to reduce cytopathologist workloads.}},
